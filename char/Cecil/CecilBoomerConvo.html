      <p style="color:#2B2F37">DR. BOOMER: Hello Cecil! Did you know that if you wait for 30 years, then 30 years will pass? Time is a beautiful mistress!</p>
      <p style="color:#FF00BA">CECIL: Hello, Boomer. Of all the people who piss me off, you almost piss me off the least. It is good to see that you were smart enough to join the right side.</p>
      <p style="color:#2B2F37">DR. BOOMER: Of course! How could I ever join the opposition to my good friend from back in the Manhattan Project days? Besides, my evil clone was planning on joining the Parcheesi side already!</p>
      <p style="color:#FF00BA">CECIL: You have an evil clone?</p>
      <p style="color:#2B2F37">DR. BOOMER: I have a regular clone, who's evil because he plays Parcheesi!</p>
      <p style="color:#FF00BA">CECIL: Fascinating. While I'd love to dive deeper into your psychology, I don't have anywhere near the time to do so. Perhaps at a later date we will speak again, and I will probe intoâ€¦ this.</p>
      <p style="color:#2B2F37">DR. BOOMER: I will speak to you again in 30 years! Have a good next 30 years!</p>
      <p style="color:#FF00BA">CECIL: I doubt it will be that long.</p>
      <p style="color:#2B2F37">DR. BOOMER: You're right! Goodbye forever, Cecil!</p>
      <p style="color:#FF00BA">CECIL: Goodbye, Boomer.</p>
