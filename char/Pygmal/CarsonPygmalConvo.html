        <p style="color:#E799A3">PYGMAL: Hello Boss, I have those reports you requested attached as files to this message. As far as I can tell, these cats really are just stray cats that wandered in. They all seem friendly enough with the staff, but fights have broken out at times amongst them.</p>
        <p style="color:#3A3B3C">CARSON: lol, thats fucking crazy. I hella like cats, and i called pest control and they are fucking EXPENSIve. Lets just keep the cats</p>
        <p style="color:#E799A3">PYGMAL: …Are you sure, boss? They are rather… unseamly, to anyone visiting.</p>
        <p style="color:#3A3B3C">CARSON: yo, whatre you saying? cats are the shit, people will go nuts to work with a cat filled workplace</p>
        <p style="color:#E799A3">PYGMAL: I would recommend at least bringing this up with the Boss, before you finalize this decision.</p>
        <p style="color:#3A3B3C">CARSON: considered it discussed and decided. This is a cat workplace now</p>
        <p style="color:#E799A3">PYGMAL: As you say, boss.</p>
