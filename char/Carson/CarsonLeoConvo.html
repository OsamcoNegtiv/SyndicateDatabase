      <p style="color:#FFA500">LEONARDO: Ey, I don't know if you should be uh callin it that. It's goin fine, I'm thinkin these cats might be a few groups of um mixed togetha. Theyve gone and claimed some a them cubicles, made little nests in em.</p>
      <p style="color:#3A3B3C">CARSON: that's cute as fuck. Think you can make sure we dont get any more cat fights now?</p>
      <p style="color:#FFA500">LEONARDO: Yeah, so long as we keep da groups separate and fed, I don't think they'll fight anymore. Only one problem doe, they wont eat cat food, only food dey hunted.</p>
      <p style="color:#3A3B3C">CARSON: hey, maybe if we let some of them on the roof, they can take care of our bird problem. Seems like a win win to me, just make sure they fight as little as possible. cat blood everywhere looks bad for us</p>
      <p style="color:#FFA500">LEONARDO: You got it, boss.</p>
