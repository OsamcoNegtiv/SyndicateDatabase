      <p>"By dreams of worlds past,</p>
      <p>Comes a game of governance,</p>
      <p>Lost on how to play.</p><br/>
      <p>But then one day there came a great downpour,</p>
      <p>With powers ripped and taken far away,</p>
      <p>To Fools, with morals bore of happenstance.</p><br/>
      <p>So a little grey man takes the country, he breaks it,</p>
      <p>Brings about the end, if these fools, they act shit,</p>
      <p>If they can't make a choice, dear god, then that's it!</p><br/>
      <p>By now was a game called Catan,</p>
      <p>Which others felt took far too long,</p>
      <p>So they played Parcheesi,</p>
      <p>With rules that were breezy,</p>
      <p>And each felt the other was wrong.</p><br/>
      <p>So eight Fools are given eight shards,</p>
      <p>they've gotta decide,</p>
      <p>or Osamco will sink the country into the ocean.</p><br/>
      <p>And that's the prophecy. :)" </p><br/>
