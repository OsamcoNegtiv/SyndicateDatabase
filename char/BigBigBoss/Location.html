      <p>It is prophesied that the way to change this land to Catan is to flip the Decision Coin. It is imperative we locate that coin to make the decision.</p>
      <p>It appears that the Decision Coin has been taken by Unbearably Wealthy and split into eight. I do believe these pieces have been sent to the "Fools" the prophecy mentions.</p>
      <p>Should we find the letters they sent out, we should open them immediately. Only with all eight pieces together shall we be able to make the decision.</p>
      <p>I am certain some letters have been lost, after the death of Wealthy. He always did like mailing stuff to himself, for no reason. It stands to reason that others might have had theirs lost as well. I must remember to check in with the post office people to retrieve the lost letters.</p><br/>
      <h1>NOTE ADDED APRIL 1ST</h1>
      <p>I am certain that the recent leaks from the government are not coincidence. I think, in all likelihood, the Fools are reading this right now. Open your letters, and make your choice. But I must ask, please, pick right. Pick Catan.</p>
