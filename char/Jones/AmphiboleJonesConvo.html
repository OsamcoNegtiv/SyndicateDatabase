      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">AMPHIBOLE: And Along Comes Jones (1965), yes?~</p>
      <p style="color:#7F3300">TOM JONES: Right on, right on, man! What's new, pussycat?</p>
      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">AMPHIBOLE: Not much that may be reported, my friend, not much at all~</p>
      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">AMPHIBOLE: However, I do have information to pass on to mine subordinates, and it is much important you pass to your own subordinates~</p>
      <p style="color:#7F3300">TOM JONES: Pass on, brother, take it from the top.</p>
      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">AMPHIBOLE: Now, this May Not Be Unusual (1965, sorta) commands from our boss, but it is imperative that we remain vigorous in our digital security~</p>
      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">AMPHIBOLE: For you see, there are some agents of the Parcheesian Government infiltrating our ranks!~</p>
      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">AMPHIBOLE: Indeed, they may just be reading this conversation, like a Spirit in the Room (2012)~</p>
      <p style="color:#7F3300">TOM JONES: That's rough, man! I Who Have Nothing have nothin' to hide from the feds, unless there's some Long Lost Suitcase.</p>
      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">AMPHIBOLE: Quite, but I request you inform your subordinates nonetheless, for I fear others may have many things to hide~</p>
      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">AMPHIBOLE: Ciao for now, my friend~</p>
