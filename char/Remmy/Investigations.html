      <p style="color:#596686">There have been disturbances.<br/><br/>
      A young man named Yurt Shultz has been causing them.<br/><br/>
      He has been posting to his Blog.<br/><br/>
      He has figured out the numbers in The Boss's password.<br/><br/>
      I had not realized they were that easy to figure out.<br/><br/>
      I must speak to him soon of changing the password.<br/><br/>
      I will delete this file once he has.
