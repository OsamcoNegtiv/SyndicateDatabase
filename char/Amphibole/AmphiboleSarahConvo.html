      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">AMPHIBOLE: My dearest Whetstone, you simply MUST remember to encrypt our conversations. I would not wish for what business we speak to become compromised!~</p>
      <p style="color:#98F516">SARAH: Yeah, yeah, I got it the first time you asked. You don't need to keep reminding me....</p>
      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">AMPHIBOLE: Wonderful, wonderful. That being said, shall we get down to business? I have much to discuss regarding our superior's plans~</p>
      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">AMPHIBOLE: For, you see, we are to be planting a spy within the ranks of those trusted by the Parcheesia Government!~</p>
      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">AMPHIBOLE: But when I say we, I of course mean our dear friend, Mr. Controller~</p>
      <p style="color:#98F516">SARAH: The remote guy? Why him? Shouldn't spies be our department?</p>
      <p style="color:#98F516">AMPHIBOLE: Ahaha, no. Spies are espionage, yes? And what is hacking but digital espionage?~</p>
      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">SARAH: I guess?</p>
      <p style="color:#98F516">AMPHIBOLE: Ah, there is no need for guesswork, my friend. For we are certain who the spy is to be!~</p>
      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">SARAH: Well? Who is it?</p>
      <p style="color:#98F516">AMPHIBOLE: The good captain shall be infiltrating the ranks of our enemies~</p>
      <p style="color:#EF4DFF">SARAH: You're not suggesting who I think you're suggesting, right? Isn't his whole deal that he's a traitor?</p>
      <p style="color:#98F516">AMPHIBOLE: Yes, but they will not expect him to betray them again, yes? Fool me once, shame upon thee, fool me twice, shame upon me~</p>
