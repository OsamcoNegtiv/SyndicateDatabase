      <p style="color:#00008B">ANTE: Hello, Pygmal. I hope this message finds you well. I would like inquire about any details regarding the operations of your boss, and if there may be a sudden opening in his position that needs filling soon.</p>
      <p style="color:#E799A3">PYGMAL: Ante, I want to message you with the news that you hope for, but I sadly cannot. While Carson's competence in his position remains in question, the boss remains steadfast in his desires to keep him employed at the top ranks of our mutual organization. I do not know what he sees in this strange strongman, but I doubt he will be going anywhere soon.</p>
      <p style="color:#00008B">ANTE: Thank you Pygmal. While this is disheartening to hear, I will continue to pursue my goals as much as I can. Though with my own machinations I must maintain, I am unsure how much progress I will be able to make on climbing our hierarchy. I wish you the best of luck in your work, Pygmal.</p>
      <p style="color:#E799A3">PYGMAL: You as well, Ante.</p>
